# SeeFood

I am a big fan of an HBO show called Silicon Valley since 2019, and I really want to make a clone of the app appeared in one of the episodes.

## Getting Started

I am going to deploy a new version of this SeeFood application and publish it to Google Play at the end of 2023.

I will put the model onto hugging face and then I planned to write a simple app with React Native or Native Android in Kotlin.

You can search 'SeeFood' on Google Play and have fun with this application in the later time.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* An Android mobile device, App Store is way too expansive
* An hotdog that you want to detect
* Be young at heart, be naive
* Just For Fun

## Why building this application


Everywhere is about machine learning and artificial intelligence since the release of ChatGPT.

I had an old version of this hotdog app but the fundamental model wasn't accurate enough. So, I am making a new one.

I also want to learn some new technology via this project.
