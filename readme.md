# SeeFood

I am a big fan of an HBO show called Silicon Valley since 2019, and I really want to make a clone of the app appeared in one of the episodes.

## Getting Started

I am going to deploy a new version of this SeeFood application and publish it to Google Play at the end of 2023.

You can search 'SeeFood' on Google Play and have fun with this application later.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* An Android mobile device, App Store is way too expansive
* An hotdog that you want to detect
* Be young at heart, be naive
* Just For Fun

## Why building this application


Everywhere is about machine learning and artificial intelligence since the release of ChatGPT.

I had an old version of this hotdog app but the fundamental model wasn't accurate enough. So, I am making a new one.

I also want to learn some new technology via this project.
